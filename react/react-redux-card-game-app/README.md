# React Redux Card Game App
This is a simple card game app. The game is played with 12 cards. The cards are shuffled and laid out in a grid face down. The player flips two cards over to find a matching pair. If the cards match, they stay flipped over. If they don't match, they are flipped back over. The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
